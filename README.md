# React Native Game of Life

John Conway's Game of Life implemented in React Native.

## Setup

```shell
$ yarn install
```

## Run

```shell
$ yarn start
```

The app can then be viewed on your device using [Expo Go](https://expo.io/client).

Note, the app will not work on a web browser since `PlatformColor` is not supported by React Native Web.
